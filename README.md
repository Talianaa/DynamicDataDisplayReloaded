DynamicDataDisplayReloaded
==========================

If you are looking for the descendent of Microsoft's DynamicDataDisplay project, you should know that it is now called InteractiveDataDisplay and you should look here https://github.com/microsoft/InteractiveDataDisplay.WPF

The goal for this project is to take the old 2009 version of the DynamicDataDisplay library that was written by Microsoft, port it to the latest Visual Studio, and then improve on it.

The base for this project is a clone of the DynamicDataDisplay Sources v0.3.4703.0 from https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=dynamicdatadisplay

The reason why I am doing this is because I have a whole lot of old code that I want to resurrect that depends on the old DynamicDataDisplay. However not only do I want to resurrect that old code, but I also want to improve on it.

Here's an example of one of the improvements I've made
